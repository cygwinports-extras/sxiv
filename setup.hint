ldesc: "sxiv is an alternative to feh and qiv. Its only dependency 
besides xlib is imlib2. The primary goal for writing sxiv is to create 
an image viewer, which only has the most basic features required for 
fast image viewing. It has vi key bindings and works nicely with tiling 
window managers."
